BONUS QUESTION
2. Write a program to check whether a number is a special number or not.

   If the sum of the factorial of digits of a number (N) is equal to the number itself,
   the number (N) is called a special number.

Eg: 145 is a special number where, 1! + 4! + 5! = 145

try it with numbers:    145, 1, 35

Hint 1: you can get each digit using a modulus and integer division of a number by 10 until the number is less than 10
    eg: 145
        145//10 = 14        145%10=5                    (5 is ones digit)
        14//10 = 1          14 % 10 = 4                 (4 is tens digit)
        at the end, 1 (which is less than 10)           (1 is hundreds digit)

hint 2: you can use `math.factorial()` to find out factorial of a number.
